# Step by step

- created a repository called react-component-library
- runned `npm init` and skipped all the default values to create a simple package.json
- `npm install react typescript @types/react --save-dev`

## Adding typescript
- `npx tsc --init` to create tsconfig.json

## Bundle
- webpack (good at creating single file bundles for large applications) / rollup (particularly good in making bundles for libraries)
- Rollup is a javascript bundler. It turns everything into a file that the all browsers can understand.
- `npm install rollup`
- plugins to rollup:
- npm install rollup @rollup/plugin-node-resolve @rollup/plugin-commonjs @rollup/plugin-typescript rollup-plugin-dts --save-dev
- added rollup.config.js
- rollup -c  -> Runs rollup with the configuration file rollup.config.js
- git init
- git ignore node_modules and dist
